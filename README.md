##**Understanding the Five Phases of the Penetration Testing Process**

Penetration testing is the process of identifying the security vulnerabilities in a system or network and trying to exploit them. The results of penetration tests play a vital role in finding and patching security flaws.
Penetration testing techniques work by orchestrating security attacks on your network. A pen test differs from a vulnerability assessment in that it goes beyond conducting an automated scan of vulnerabilities and actually involves the manual exploitation of identified vulnerabilities by network security experts.
There are, generally speaking, 5 phases all pen testers will go through when performing a penetration test on a target.
Each phase I've included here contains information I've gathered and included in my personal pen testing notes.

The Five Phases

##**Phase 1. Reconnaissance**

Purpose: Gather information about the target system or network to understand the potential attack surface.
Techniques:
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering: Collect publicly available information from sources like social media, search engines, and public databases.
Example:
Tool: theHarvester
Command: theHarvester -d example.com -b all
Explanation: The above command utilizes theHarvester tool to perform OSINT gathering for the target domain "example.com" using all available modules. This command can provide email addresses, subdomains, hosts, and other relevant information.

Network scanning: Perform scans to identify live hosts, open ports, and services.
Example:
Tool: Nmap
Command: nmap -p- -T4 example.com
Explanation: The above command uses Nmap to perform a TCP port scan on the target domain "example.com" using aggressive timing. It scans all ports to identify open ports and services running on them.

WHOIS lookup: Retrieve domain registration information to identify the organization associated with the target.
Example:
Tool: whois
Command: whois example.com
Explanation: The above command uses the whois command-line tool to retrieve domain registration information for "example.com". This includes details about the domain owner, registrar, and other relevant information.

DNS enumeration: Enumerate DNS records to gather information about the target's domain names and subdomains.
Example:
Tool: dnsrecon
Command: dnsrecon -d example.com -t std
Explanation: The above command utilizes the dnsrecon tool to perform DNS enumeration for the target domain "example.com" using standard mode. This command can reveal subdomains, associated IP addresses, and other DNS-related information.

##**Phase 2. Vulnerability Assessment**

Purpose: Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system.
Techniques:
Vulnerability scanning: Use automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities by comparing system configurations and software versions against a vulnerability database.
Example:
Tool: Nessus
Command: nessuscli scan --targets example.com --template "Full Audit"
Explanation: The above command utilizes Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanning tool, to perform a full audit scan on the target domain "example.com". It checks for a wide range of vulnerabilities based on the selected template.

Manual inspection: Conduct a thorough manual analysis of the target system to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations not detected by automated tools.
Example:
Scenario: Web Application Security Assessment
Technique: Source code review
Explanation: In this scenario, a manual inspection technique involves reviewing the source code of a web application to identify potential vulnerabilities or weak security controls. This can include searching for common coding mistakes, insecure practices, or unvalidated user input.

Network vulnerability analysis: Assess network devices, such as routers and firewalls, for potential vulnerabilities.
Example:
Tool: OpenVAS
Command: openvas-cli --target example.com --port 443 --username admin --password password --xml vulnscan.xml
Explanation: The above command uses OpenVAS, an open-source vulnerability scanner, to perform a vulnerability scan on the target domain "example.com" specifically targeting port 443 (HTTPS). The scan results are saved in the XML format in the file vulnscan.xml.

Fuzzing: Generate and send malformed or unexpected input to a target application or service to identify potential vulnerabilities.
Example:
Tool: wfuzz
Scenario: Web Application Fuzzing
Technique: Parameter fuzzing
Explanation: In this scenario, the wfuzz tool is used to perform parameter fuzzing on a web application. The tool sends a variety of payloads with different parameter values to the application, aiming to trigger unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. For example:
wfuzz -c -z file,wordlist.txt --hh 0 "http://example.com/?FUZZ=test"
This command uses wfuzz to fuzz the parameter "test" in the URL "[http://example.com/?FUZZ=test](http://example.com/?FUZZ=test)" using payloads from the wordlist file wordlist.txt. The -c option specifies to show output for non-empty responses, and --hh 0 suppresses response headers.

Exploitation using Metasploit Framework: Exploit known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over the target system.
Example:
Tool: Metasploit Framework
Command: msfconsole
Explanation: The above command opens the Metasploit console, which provides an extensive collection of exploit modules and payloads for testing and exploiting vulnerabilities. It allows penetration testers to search for specific exploits, configure options, and launch attacks against vulnerable systems.
 
##**Phase 3. Exploitation**

Purpose: Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over the target system.
Generalized List of Vulnerabilities:
Remote Code Execution (RCE): Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow executing arbitrary code on the target system.
Example: Exploiting a command injection vulnerability in a web application to execute system commands.

SQL Injection: Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow manipulating database queries to retrieve unauthorized information or modify the database.
Example: Manipulating an input parameter in a web application to extract sensitive data from the database.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
Example: Injecting JavaScript code in a user input field to steal session cookies or perform phishing attacks.

File Inclusion: Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow including arbitrary files from the target system.
Example: Exploiting a path traversal vulnerability to include sensitive files, such as configuration files.

Remote File Inclusion (RFI): Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow including remote files from external servers.
Example: Exploiting a misconfigured file inclusion vulnerability to execute malicious PHP code from a remote server.

Example Methods for Gaining a Foothold:
Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities:
Command Injection
SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
File Inclusion
Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
Exploiting Network Services:
Buffer Overflow
Weak Authentication
Service Exploitation
 
##**Phase 4. Post-Exploitation**

Purpose: Exploit the compromised system further, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence.
Privilege Escalation Methods:
Local Privilege Escalation:
Exploiting vulnerable services or misconfigurations to elevate privileges on the local system.
Example: Exploiting a vulnerable setuid binary or weak file permissions.
Horizontal Privilege Escalation:
Exploiting the compromised user's privileges to gain access to other user accounts on the same system.
Example: Exploiting weak password reuse or misconfigured access controls.
Vertical Privilege Escalation:
Exploiting the compromised user's privileges to gain access to higher privileged accounts on the same system.
Example: Exploiting weak password policies or misconfigured sudo permissions.
Domain Privilege Escalation:
Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in a Windows Active Directory environment to elevate privileges within the domain.
Example: Exploiting weak group policies or misconfigured trust relationships.
Maintaining Persistence:
Backdoors:
Installing persistent backdoors to maintain access to the compromised system.
Example: Creating a hidden user account with remote access capabilities.
Rootkits:
Installing rootkits or kernel-level malware to hide malicious activities and maintain control over the system.
Example: Patching system binaries to hide malicious processes.
Lateral Movement:
Expanding access to other systems within the network by compromising additional hosts.
Example: Exploiting vulnerabilities in network services or using stolen credentials.
